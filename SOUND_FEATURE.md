# Sound Feature Implementation

## Overview

The application now includes a sound feature that provides audio feedback when users check or uncheck tasks and subtasks. This enhances the user experience by providing immediate auditory confirmation of their actions.

## Features

### Sound Types

- **Task Completion**: Higher pitch ascending tone (800Hz → 1200Hz)
- **Task Unchecking**: Lower pitch descending tone (600Hz → 400Hz)
- **Subtask Completion**: Higher pitched quick tone (1000Hz → 1400Hz)
- **Subtask Unchecking**: Lower pitched quick tone (500Hz → 300Hz)

### Sound Settings

- **Toggle Sound**: Enable/disable all sound effects
- **Volume Control**: Adjust volume from 0% to 100%
- **Test Sound**: Play a sample sound to test the current settings
- **Persistent Settings**: Sound preferences are saved in localStorage

### Technical Implementation

#### Sound Generation

- Uses Web Audio API's `OscillatorNode` and `GainNode`
- Generates sine wave tones with frequency ramping
- Implements fade-in/fade-out for smooth audio transitions
- Different frequencies and durations for different actions

#### Settings Persistence

- Sound enabled/disabled state saved in localStorage
- Volume level saved in localStorage
- Settings persist across browser sessions

#### User Interface

- Sound settings button in the header (speaker icon)
- Modal with toggle switch and volume slider
- Test sound functionality
- Clear visual feedback for current settings

## Usage

1. **Accessing Sound Settings**: Click the speaker icon in the top-right corner of the header
2. **Enabling/Disabling**: Use the toggle switch in the settings modal
3. **Adjusting Volume**: Use the slider to set volume from 0% to 100%
4. **Testing**: Click the "Test Sound" button to hear the current settings
5. **Automatic Playback**: Sounds play automatically when checking/unchecking tasks and subtasks

## Browser Compatibility

- Requires modern browsers with Web Audio API support
- Gracefully handles browsers without audio support
- Settings are preserved across sessions

## Future Enhancements
